            <p class="text-base">When I first started coding, I was amazed at how a few lines of code could create
                something that people could interact with and enjoy. I quickly realized that coding was not just a tool
                to build websites and applications, but a form of creative expression that allowed me to bring my ideas
                to life. Whether I'm building a simple webpage or a complex application, I love the process of
                problem-solving and the feeling of accomplishment when I see my code come to life.</p>
